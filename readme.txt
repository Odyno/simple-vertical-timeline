The button "Simple Vertical Timeline"  allow you to create the main vertical line were all of your events will be placed... so select one place on your article and click on this button: two new shortcode will be added in the palace selected. This is your first step! you have create the tempo line!

= STEP B =
The button "Event for Simple Vertical Timeline" add a new event in the tempo line. It's very easy, move the pointer into the new element already created and click on it. One dialog will ask you to decide the title, just a quick starting note, the date and the color of node in the time line.
The result is the same of previous button, one shortcode will be added on the place of mouse and the new event with all the information will be shown on the page
